      "1. **Definition**: The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a financial metric used to evaluate the valuation of a company's stock by comparing its current share price to its earnings per share (EPS).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **PE Ratio for 2021**: The PE ratio for 2021 is calculated by dividing the company's stock price at the end of 2021 by its EPS for the year 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **PE Ratio for 2020**: Similarly, the PE ratio for 2020 is obtained by dividing the stock price at the end of 2020 by the EPS for the year 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **PE Ratio for 2019**: The PE ratio for 2019 is determined by dividing the stock price at the end of 2019 by the EPS for the year 2019.\n",
